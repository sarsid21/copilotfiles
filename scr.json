To support business and security needs, custom banned password lists can be defined. When users change or <br />reset their passwords, these banned password lists are checked to enforce the use of strong passwords.</p> <p>A custom banned password list should include some of the&nbsp; following examples:</p> <ul> <li>Brand names</li> <li>Product names</li> <li>Locations, such as company headquarters</li> <li>Company-specific internal terms</li> <li>Abbreviations that have specific company meaning</li> </ul> <p><strong>Rationale</strong>:<br />Creating a new password can be difficult regardless of one's technical background. It is common to look around one's environment for suggestions when building a password, however, this may include picking words specific to the&nbsp; organization as inspiration for a password. An adversary may employ what is called a 'mangler' to create permutations of these specific words in an attempt to crack passwords or hashes making it easier to reach their goal.</p>",
